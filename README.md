# WordEmbedding
different word analogies with a Word2Vec Model

Word embeddings are numerical representation of words, in the form of vectors.

Word2Vec Model represents each word as 300 Dimensional Vector

In this project we are going to see how to use pre-trained word2vec model.

Model size is around 1.5 GB
We will work using Gensim, which is popular NLP Package.

Applications
Text Similarity
Language Translation
Finding Odd Words
Word Analogies
